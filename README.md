# ![](./icon.png)Dockerized ftp upload

Provides a Docker container which can upload a local directory tree to
a remote ftp server - also available via [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gernotstarke/ftp-uploader/)

It's used e.g. for static sites generated by Jekyll - for sites that don't offer ssh or scp access.

## How it works

* provide a Docker container with [ncftp]() - a powerful ftp client
that can handle directory trees

* the container is supposed to be started by a command like that:

    docker -it run gernotstarke/ftp-uploader <site> <server> <localdir>

* the container starts the script 'upload.sh' upon startup, that queries
  for username and password.
